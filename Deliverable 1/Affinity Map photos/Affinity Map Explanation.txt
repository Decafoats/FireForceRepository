Affinity map contributions
For our affinity map we split our project ideas into different aspects
1. Design - How would we design our app/project
2. Tools - The technology we would use to build
3. Kid Friendly - How will we make our project engaging to children

Phase 1
We spent some time to brainstorm any ideas for each theme
All members wrote their ideas in different coloured sticky notes
Dark Green -Jonathan
Blue - Jack
Neon Green - Zain

Phase 2
We then put all of the items in each category in different subcategories.
1. Design
	-UI   How the interface will be designed
	-UX   experiences we can achieve
2. Tools
	-Software   Any programming language or software available
	-hardware   Any Hardware that we can use 
3. Kid Firendly
	-Grab Attention   How to first engage children to dial and talk
	-Reward System    A system that will encourage learning
	-Keep attention   Something to keep children engaged 
	-Kid retention    How to achieve deep learning
